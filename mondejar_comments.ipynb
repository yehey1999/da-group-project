    "#### Prediction Errors\n",
    "One of the simplest methods for calculating the correctness of a model is to use the error between predicted value and actual value. MSE is the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value, MAE tells us how big of an error we can expect from the forecast on average and lastly, RMSE is the square root of average value of squared error in a set of predicted values, without considering direction. <br><br>\n",
    "As shown below, with the fact that RMSE is higher than the MAE, this implies that there is variation in the magnitude of errors and very large errors are unlikely to have occured. Thus, with RMSE not being too much high than MAE, implies that there is no outlier in the data."
